                            This training helps to write codes for an actual Quantum Computer and execute it in both the

                            environment and on the actual Quantum Device. We will get familiar with the basics of
                            quantum computation
                            and understand their implementation in Python using the IBM Software Development Kit called

                            and anyone interested
                            in Quantum Computation. By the end of this project, you will be able to implement and
                            comprehend a Quantum algorithm
                            that outperforms its classical variants.</p>
